# Car Number Plate Detection using OpenCV and EasyOCR

(N.B This is a running project for one of my masters course)

### Steps which are followed
1. Using OpenCV with Python, car image is read and visualised
2. Applying color shifts and changes to images (e.g. grayscaling and BGR2RGB)
3. Using OpenCV findCountours, contours are detectd  
4. Masking number plates to improve text extraction for OCR
5. Using EasyOCR, number plate text is extracted
